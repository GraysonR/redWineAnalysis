Fixed acidity seems to be positively skewed while volatile acidity is less harshly skewed but has some positive outliers while citric acid has a almost exponential distribution.\n\n```{r Chlorides histogram, echo=FALSE}\nggplot(data = rw, aes(chlorides)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.025, color = 'red') +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, .05))\n\nggplot(data = rw, aes(chlorides)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, color = 'red') +\n  scale_x_log10(breaks = pretty_breaks(rw$chlorides, n = 10)) +\n  labs(x = 'chlorides (log10)')\n\nggplot(data = subset(rw, chlorides < quantile(chlorides, .98)), \n       aes(chlorides)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.005, color = 'red') +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, .2, .025))\n\n# Median\nmedian(rw$chlorides)\n```\nThere are several major outliers for chloride measurment, but around the mean and median the distribution is normal.\n\n\n```{r Sulfur Dioxide, echo=FALSE}\nggplot(data = rw, aes(free.sulfur.dioxide)) +\n  geom_histogram( color = 'red', binwidth = 2) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 75, 8)) +\n  labs(x = 'Free Sulfur Dioxide (mg / dm^3)')\n\nggplot(data = subset(rw, total.sulfur.dioxide < quantile(total.sulfur.dioxide, .99)), \n       aes(total.sulfur.dioxide)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = 'red', binwidth = 5) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 150, 15)) +\n  labs(x = 'Total Sulfur Dioxide (mg / dm^3)')\n```\nBoth measueres of sulfur dioxide are positively skewed. This makes sense because according to the description of the data \"SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm [are] evident in the nose and taste of wine.\"   \n\n```{r Sulfur above 50 ppm}\n# Number of entries with sulfur ppm above 50.\ndim(subset(rw, total.sulfur.dioxide >= 50))[1]\n557 / 1599\n```\nOut of the 1599 entries there are 557 with SO2 above 50. This is about 34.8% of the entries.\n\n```{r Residual Sugars, echo=FALSE}\nggplot(data = rw, \n       aes(residual.sugar)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = 'red', binwidth = 0.2)\n\nggplot(data = subset(rw,residual.sugar < quantile(residual.sugar, .99)),\n       aes(residual.sugar)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = 'red', binwidth = 0.2) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 8, .4))\n\nsummary(rw$residual.sugar)\n```\nResidual sugars are normal with outliers.  \nThis seems to be a reoccurring pattern. Later it may be interesting to compare the tails with each other to see if there is a correlation between the extremes and good or bad wine.\n\n```{r Density, echo=FALSE}\nggplot(data = rw, aes(density)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = .0005, color = 'red') +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(.985, 1.01, 0.0015))\n```\nDensity is tightly distributed with a normal distribution showing no apparent skewness.\n\n```{r Sulphates, echo=FALSE}\nggplot(data = rw, aes(sulphates)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = .03, color = 'red')\n\nggplot(data = subset(rw, sulphates < quantile(sulphates, .99)), \n       aes(sulphates)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = .03, color = 'red') +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1.25, .075))\n\nsummary(rw$sulphates)\n```\nPositively skewed with extreme positive outliers. Also, the entries are fairly spread out. According to the data file sulphates \"can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas\".\n\n```{r Sulphates and sulfur dioxide, echo=FALSE}\nplt1 <- ggplot(data = rw, aes(sulphates)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = .03, color = 'red')\n\nplt2 <- ggplot(data = rw, aes(total.sulfur.dioxide)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = 'red', binwidth = 5) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 300, 15)) +\n  labs(x = 'Total Sulfur Dioxide (mg / dm^3)')\n\ngrid.arrange(plt1, plt2, ncol = 1)\n```\nBoth do have similar tails, but the total sulfur dioxide is not as normal as the sulphates",
